This would have been a note to my code, not a bit code...!
OK I'm not a GITer and I'm just trying to get a hint of a problem...

I have this tiny code who just using some external library-funktions.

After some trubble I could pass the 1st function with success.
With a lot of breakpoints I stepped into the 2nd function...
..but the result was like to enter into a black hole i space !

Absulutly nothing happens, but I can "stop" the debugging...
Somewere "in the binary hyper space" the execution continuing ?

Give me a clue why, PLZ !
